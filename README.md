# backend
"Backend" refers to the Cloud Integration project

The aim was to discover and get to grips with Spring, a popular enterprise framework for connecting our application to an H2 database. It also enabled us to understand how to use GitHub actions piplines, a tool for maintaining applications.

The following points were covered:
-> create a web service,
-> create an "item" entity and a service,
-> retrieve an "item" and use an H2 database,
-> write tests to validate that the implemented functionalities give the expected result
-> use / configure piplines on GitHub actions
-> use Docker to generate an image and a container to run our application on
